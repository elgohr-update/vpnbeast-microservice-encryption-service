[![CI](https://github.com/vpnbeast/encryption-service/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/vpnbeast/encryption-service/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is a web server created for encrypting strings based on [AES-256](https://www.solarwindsmsp.com/blog/aes-256-encryption-algorithm) 
and returns the encrypted response as `JSON`. This service also has capability of checking the clear and encrypted strings, 
takes clear and encrypted strings as JSON and returns a JSON response to check if both strings are compatible with each other.
